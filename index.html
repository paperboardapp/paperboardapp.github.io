      Paperboard Development Update 1
    </h1>
    <p><em>2022/08/23</em></p>
    <p>
      Since this is our first development update and we never properly
      introduced the project before we want to give some background on the
      history of the project before diving into the current development efforts
      in our next update.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-paperboard">Why Paperboard</h2>
    <p>
      Like many projects Paperboard started as an experiment in applying a
      unique set of design decisions, both on a technical as well as on a user
      experience level, to a certain problem domain, in this case a virtual
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond being an interesting experiment there was one particular reason
      that we started to build Paperboard. And that was our frustration in using
      existing virtual boards to track our product development tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many other boards out there and most of them make it easy enough
      to add content fast. But managing and reorganizing these elements quickly
      turns into an exercise in frustration. We were not satisfied with these
      existing solutions so we started to experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that end the prime directive of Paperboard is making it effortless to
      organize and reorganize the elements on the virtual board.
    </p>
    <h2 id="paperboard-ux">Paperboard UX</h2>
    <p>
      One of the original ideas in the first Paperboard prototype was what is
      nowadays called “displacement” in the code. A card will push an element up
      or down when placed on top of it so elements never overlap. The primary
      goal of this functionality was to avoid the annoyance of having to
      rearrange cards manually.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./displacement-example.gif" alt="displacement example" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">displacement example</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It works well enough but has its limitations. We are still considering
      turning it into a setting. There are a number of ways it could be improved
      though but this could be the topic of another development update.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-grid">The Grid</h3>
    <p>
      Since the basic card displacement does not really cut it if you want to
      represent something like a story map the next idea was the grid. In its
      first incarnation the grid was an element that had to be created
      separately but later we changed this so it is created automatically if
      cards collide.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./grid-demo.gif" alt="grid demo" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">grid demo</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It seems neat but we never added enough functionality for it to actually
      be usable as a story map and ultimately we removed the functionality
      entirely in a recent change in favor of the table.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-table">The Table</h3>
    <p>
      The idea of a table element came very early in the Paperboard project but
      we had many doubts about the feasibility of the UX we were aiming for. The
      concept is pretty straightforward, a table can have any number of rows and
      columns and every cell can contain any number of elements in arbitrary
      positions within the cell.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./table-demo.gif" alt="table demo" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">table demo</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It doesn’t seem that hard at first glance but there are a number of
      interesting edge cases that you need to deal with. We are still working on
      improving the table UI, to make it prettier and add some missing features.
      But the basic concept works well. We use it daily on our own development
      board and it has proven effective in managing our tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think the table could in the future also gain some features of the
      grid.
    </p>
    <h3 id="imports-collaboration-and-more">
      Imports, Collaboration, and more
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are many more features that are already implemented in Paperboard,
      like basic data imports from Jira or Linear. Paperboard is also already a
      live board that can be collaborated on in real-time as you would expect
      from such a tool. We will be writing about these and many more features in
      more detail in future updates.
    </p>
    <h2 id="where-are-we-going">Where are we going?</h2>
    <p>
      While you can use the basic cards and elements in Paperboard to track your
      product development tasks we don’t want to build another issue tracking
      tool or build backlog items, sprints or anything like that into
      Paperboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many tools out there that already do a great job with that. But
      the reality of modern software product development is that there are
      usually many such tools in use in a single company, even in a single team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downside of most of these tools is their lack of visual nature. They
      are mostly built around infinite lists of items which don’t afford any
      size constraints. And human cognition is fundamentally built on the
      perception of space and the spatial relationship of objects around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why we believe there is a lot of value in being able to bring all
      these diverse sources of information on a visual board and being able to
      organize and cross-reference them as you see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just picture being able to get an overview of all your ongoing work in
      progress across the whole company. Or being able to visualize the
      dependencies between your development teams that are right now hidden
      inside tasks in infinite lists that are out-of-sight out-of-mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine being able to see all the tasks across departments related to a
      single product effort, like marketing, development, operations, etc. all
      together on the board at the level of detail you need to understand where
      you are at.
    </p>
    <p>This is where we think the future of Paperboard lies.</p>
