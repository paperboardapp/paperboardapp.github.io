<h1 id="paperboard-development-update-1">Paperboard Development Update
1</h1>
<p><em>2022/08/23</em></p>
<p>Since this is our first development update and we never properly
introduced the project before we want to give some background on the
history of the project before diving into the current development
efforts in our next update.</p>
<h2 id="why-paperboard">Why Paperboard</h2>
<p>Like many projects Paperboard started as an experiment in applying a
unique set of design decisions, both on a technical as well as on a user
experience level, to a certain problem domain, in this case a virtual
board.</p>
<p>But beyond being an interesting experiment there was one particular
reason that we started to build Paperboard. And that was our frustration
in using existing virtual boards to track our product development
tasks.</p>
<p>There are many other boards out there and most of them make it easy
enough to add content fast. But managing and reorganizing these elements
quickly turns into an exercise in frustration. We were not satisfied
with these existing solutions so we started to experiment.</p>
<p>To that end the prime directive of Paperboard is making it effortless
to organize and reorganize the elements on the virtual board.</p>
<h2 id="paperboard-ux">Paperboard UX</h2>
<p>One of the original ideas in the first Paperboard prototype was what
is nowadays called “displacement” in the code. A card will push an
element up or down when placed on top of it so elements never overlap.
The primary goal of this functionality was to avoid the annoyance of
having to rearrange cards manually.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">displacement example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It works well enough but has its limitations. We are still
considering turning it into a setting. There are a number of ways it
could be improved though but this could be the topic of another
development update.</p>
<h3 id="the-grid">The Grid</h3>
<p>Since the basic card displacement does not really cut it if you want
to represent something like a story map the next idea was the grid. In
its first incarnation the grid was an element that had to be created
separately but later we changed this so it is created automatically if
cards collide.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./grid-demo.gif" alt="grid demo" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">grid demo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It seems neat but we never added enough functionality for it to
actually be usable as a story map and ultimately we removed the
functionality entirely in a recent change in favor of the table.</p>
<h3 id="the-table">The Table</h3>
<p>The idea of a table element came very early in the Paperboard project
but we had many doubts about the feasibility of the UX we were aiming
for. The concept is pretty straightforward, a table can have any number
of rows and columns and every cell can contain any number of elements in
arbitrary positions within the cell.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./table-demo.gif" alt="table demo" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">table demo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It doesn’t seem that hard at first glance but there are a number of
interesting edge cases that you need to deal with. We are still working
on improving the table UI, to make it prettier and add some missing
features. But the basic concept works well. We use it daily on our own
development board and it has proven effective in managing our tasks.</p>
<p>We think the table could in the future also gain some features of the
grid.</p>
<h3 id="imports-collaboration-and-more">Imports, Collaboration, and
more</h3>
<p>There are many more features that are already implemented in
Paperboard, like basic data imports from Jira or Linear. Paperboard is
also already a live board that can be collaborated on in real-time as
you would expect from such a tool. We will be writing about these and
many more features in more detail in future updates.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-we-going">Where are we going?</h2>
<p>While you can use the basic cards and elements in Paperboard to track
your product development tasks we don’t want to build another issue
tracking tool or build backlog items, sprints or anything like that into
Paperboard.</p>
<p>There are many tools out there that already do a great job with that.
But the reality of modern software product development is that there are
usually many such tools in use in a single company, even in a single
team.</p>
<p>The downside of most of these tools is their lack of visual nature.
They are mostly built around infinite lists of items which don’t afford
any size constraints. And human cognition is fundamentally built on the
perception of space and the spatial relationship of objects around
us.</p>
<p>This is why we believe there is a lot of value in being able to bring
all these diverse sources of information on a visual board and being
able to organize and cross-reference them as you see fit.</p>
<p>Just picture being able to get an overview of all your ongoing work
in progress across the whole company. Or being able to visualize the
dependencies between your development teams that are right now hidden
inside tasks in infinite lists that are out-of-sight out-of-mind.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to see all the tasks across departments related to
a single product effort, like marketing, development, operations, etc.
all together on the board at the level of detail you need to understand
where you are at.</p>
<p>This is where we think the future of Paperboard lies.</p>
